## Overview

Web Starter Kit with Bootstrap is a modified version of Google's [Web Starter Kit](https://developers.google.com/web/starter-kit) that has the default Style Guide replaced with [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap). Aim of the project is to allow developers access to all the powerful building tools WSK has on offer while letting them work with their favorite front-end framework, Bootstrap.

- Web Starter Kit version: 0.6.1
- Bootstrap version: 3.3.6+ (always uses master version available from bower repositories)

## Quickstart

Check out README.MD for WSK for detailed explanation of what is going on here.

- Clone the repository.
- run ```npm install``` (might require sudo)
- run ```bower install```
- Perfect, you're ready. Now run ```gulp serve``` to start devmode (with a custom minified server) or ```gulp``` to create production-ready build.
